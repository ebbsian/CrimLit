# Advantages of Summary Trials
- Shorter (especially relevant for clients in custody)
- Cheaper (especially relevant for private funded clients)
- Clients may, on conviction, have to pay towards the prosecution costs as well as their own
- Automatic right of appeal, but that's mainly because MC is less legally rigourous
- Shorter custody time limits
- While the sentencing powers are limited, this isn't foolproof as it could always be committed up for sentencing

# Advantages of Crown Court Trials
- Lower conviction rates
- The defendant gets the chance to put their case before a jury, who may be more sympathetic to personal circumstances
- Longer process is good if the client is on bail and thinks they'll get custody
- Evidential issues are dealt with in the absence of the jury, as opposed to in MC where the magistrates will have to look at it (though a pre-trial ruling could avoid this)

# Defence Statements
###### Source: D9.30

>> Once the case has been sent to the court and the prosecution case has been served, the accused must give a defence statement.
>> [[CPIA 1996 s5]]

 
This is a written statement setting out the basis on which the case will be defended. 
It must include: 
- The nature of the defence, including any particular defences.
- Any matters of fact, the accused takes issue with from the prosecution and why they take issue with them.
- Details of any facts that defence needs to rely on
- Any points of law the defendant intends to use and the relevant authorities 
\- [[CPIA 1996 s6A]] 

**Note**
The duty of disclosure is therefore different to the duty on the prosecution. The prosecution has to disclose unused material, whereas the defence only needs to disclose what they'll be actually relying upon in court.

## Defence Statements in Cases Tried Summarily
###### Source: D9.38
- There is no obligation on the defence to provide a defence statement in cases tried summarily. 
- However, the defendant may choose to make one once the prosecution statement is served anyway.
- The defendant must make a defence statement if they want to apply for specific  disclosure under [[CPIA 1996 s8]]. The court cannot make an order for the disclosure of unused prosecution materials without it.
- If a defence statement is being made, it must be done within **14 days** of the disclosure of materials by the prosecution - CPIA 1996 (*Defence Disclosure Time Limits) Regulations)* 2011
- The accused can apply to the court to extend this time limit
- Where a defence statement is provided, the same rules in [[CPIA 1996 s6A]] apply w/r/t its contents
- The voluntary rule applies to summary only, E/W and youth indictable offences
