## Definition of 'Initial Details'
*Where the accused is in custody for the offence charged*: 
- a summary of the circumstances of the offence 
- The accused's criminal record

- Summary of the circumstances of the offence 
- Any account given by the accused in interview 
- Any written witness statements, including exhibits which are material to the plea , allocation or sentence 
- Any available impact statements

## Information Sufficiency

- An accused may attend preliminary and sentence hearings by video link - [[CDA 1998 s.57A]]
- [[CDA 1998 s.57A]](2) - the accused is to be treated as present when appearing by video link.
- [[CDA 1998 s.57A]](3) - Video link - the accused may see and hear, and be seen and heard by the court during the hearing.
- [[CrimPR 3.2]](4) encourages the use of live links.
- If the hearing is open to the public, the barriers of security are lower and tools such as Skype may be used.
- In theory, nothing prevents the online hearing to be done virtually for all participants, so long as it is still open to the public.

- If an accused pleads guilty via live link and the court wishes to proceed straight to sentencing via live link, that's fine, provided the court doesn't think it's against the interests of justice - [[CDA 1998 s.57D]](2)
- The same applies for the accused giving oral evidence at the sentencing hearing - [[CDA 1998 s.57D]](3)
